### Background
These are two game projects I completed during a crash course in Processing. 
It utilizes many of the tutorials on collisions and rendering shapes.

### Home Run Derby Game
#### Gameplay:
A player has three strikes to hit as many Homeruns as possible. A ball will be successfully hit if 1) The swing is timed correctly and 2) The batter is moved close enough to the ball. Players are awarded additional free swings if they do not swing at pitches outside the strike zone.

This project later implemented an arduino and motion sensor. Unfortunatly all that is left of this iteration is a [short video](http://raycoti.com/index.php/2016/09/09/tbt-home-run-derby-game/).

### Collision Game
#### Gameplay:
You have to hit the ball with your paddle, this is done by clicking and dragging your paddle along the screen. Each time it makes contact the ball will speed up, change color and get smaller.
