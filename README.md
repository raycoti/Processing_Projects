Home Run Derby Game and Collision Game


These are two game projects I completed during a crash course in Processing. 
It utilizes many of the tutorials on collisions and rendering shapes.
The home-run derby game was later edited to get input from a sensor to swing
That code will be uploaded when/if I find it.
